## Compiled hex files

In this folder compiled images of the project are provided
* 'SensorAggregation_v0.3_MergedCores.hex' contains the application alone.
* 'SensorAggregation_v0.3_Bootloader_MergedCores.hex' contains the application and the bootloader.

These images contain the merged images for both Application and Network Cores of NORA-B1.

These images can be programmed in the device using a J-Link and [Nordicâ€™s nRF Connect for Desktop](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-tools/nRF-Connect-for-desktop) and more specifically the *Programmer app*. The device should be reset after programming.
