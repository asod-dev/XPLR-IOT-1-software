/** @file
 * @brief This header file defines the network API. These functions are
 * thread-safe.
 *
 * The functions here should be used in the following sequence; think
 * of it as "ready, steady, go ... off".
 *
 * uNetworkInit():   call this at start of day in order to make this API
 *                   available. READY.
 * uNetworkAdd():    call this when you would like to begin using the
 *                   network: when it returns the module is powered-up
 *                   and ready for configuration. STEADY.
 * uNetworkUp():     call this when you would like the network to connect;
 *                   after this is called you can send and receive stuff
 *                   over the network. GO.
 * uNetworkDown():   disconnect and shut-down the network; once this has
 *                   returned the module may enter a lower-power or
 *                   powered-off state: you must call uNetworkUp() to
 *                   talk with it again. OFF.
 * uNetworkRemove(): call this to clear up any resources belonging to
 *                   the network; once this is called uNetworkAdd()
 *                   must be called once more to re-instantiate the
 *                   network.
 * uNetworkDeinit(): call this at end of day in order to clear up any
 *                   resources owned by this API.  This internally calls
 *                   uNetworkRemove() for any networks that haven't already
 *                   been cleaned-up.

/** Initialise the network API.  If the network API has already
 * been initialised this function returns success without doing

 *
 * @return  zero on success else negative error code.

/** Deinitialise the network API.  Any network instances will
 * be removed internally with a call to uNetworkRemove().

/** Add a network instance. When this returns successfully
 * the module is powered up and available for configuration but
 * is not yet connected to anything.
 *
 * @param type             the type of network to create,
 *                         Wifi (in future BLE), cellular, etc.
 * @param pConfiguration   a pointer to the configuration
 *                         information for the given network
 *                         type.  This must be stored
 *                         statically, a true constant: the
 *                         contents are not copied by this
 *                         function. The configuration
 *                         structures are defined by this
 *                         API in the u_network_xxx.h header
 *                         files and have the name
 *                         uNetworkConfigurationXxx_t, where
 *                         xxx is replaced by one of Cell,
 *                         Ble or Wifi.  The configuration
 *                         is passed transparently through to
 *                         the given API, hence the use of
 *                         void * here. The first entry in
 *                         all of these structures is of type
 *                         uNetworkType_t to indicate the
 *                         type and allow cross-checking.
 * @return                 on success the handle of the
 *                         network instance, else negative
 *                         error code.  This handle may also
 *                         be used with the underlying sho/cell
 *                         API to perform operations that
 *                         cannot be carried out through
 *                         this network API.
