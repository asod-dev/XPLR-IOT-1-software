 * IMPORTANT: some platforms, specifically Zephyr, used on NRF53,

 *
 * @param uart                   the UART HW block to use.
 * @param baudRate               the baud rate to use.

 *                               do not support passing in a buffer
 *                               (an error will be returned) so to be
