 * FUNCTIONS

/** Initialise the cellular MQTT client.  If the client is already
 * initialised then this function returns immediately. The
 * module must be powered up for this function to work.
 * IMPORTANT: if you re-boot the cellular module after calling this
 * function you will lose all settings and must call uCellMqttDeinit()
 * followed by uCellMqttInit() to put them back again.
 *
 * @param cellHandle         the handle of the cellular instance
 *                           to be used.
 * @param pBrokerNameStr     the null-terminated string that gives
 *                           the name of the broker for this MQTT
 *                           session.  This may be a domain name,
 *                           or an IP address and may include a port
 *                           number.  NOTE: if a domain name is used
 *                           the module may immediately try to perform
 *                           a DNS look-up to establish the IP address
 *                           of the broker and hence you should ensure
 *                           that the module is connected beforehand.
 * @param pClientIdStr       the null-terminated string that
 *                           will be the client ID for this
 *                           MQTT session.  May be NULL, in
 *                           which case the driver will provide
 *                           a name.
 * @param pUserNameStr       the null-terminated string that is the
 *                           user name required by the MQTT broker.
 * @param pPasswordStr       the null-terminated string that is the
 *                           password required by the MQTT broker.
 * @param pKeepGoingCallback certain of the MQTT API functions
 *                           need to wait for the broker to respond
 *                           and this may take some time.  Specify
 *                           a callback function here which will be
 *                           called while the API is waiting.  While
 *                           the callback function returns true the
 *                           API will continue to wait until success
 *                           or U_MQTT_CLIENT_RESPONSE_WAIT_SECONDS
 *                           is reached.  If the callback function
 *                           returns false then the API will return.
 *                           Note that the thing the API was waiting for
 *                           may still succeed, this does not cancel
 *                           the operation, it simply stops waiting
 *                           for the response.  The callback function
 *                           may also be used to feed any application
 *                           watchdog timer that may be running.
 *                           May be NULL, in which case the
 *                           APIs will continue to wait until success
 *                           or U_MQTT_CLIENT_RESPONSE_WAIT_SECONDS.
 * @param futureExpansion    in this version of this API this field
 *                           is ignored.
 * @return                   zero on success or negative error code on
 *                           failure.
