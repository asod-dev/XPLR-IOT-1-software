# NFC Functionality
NFC functionality is not an essential functional component for Sensor Aggregation Use Case application. The user can disable/remove it without affecting the rest of the application.

NFC functionality is added as part of this application, just to allow the user to perform a basic scan of XPLR-IOT-1 with an NFC-enabled device and test this feature.

The user can scan XPLR-IOT-1 by placing the NFC device (mobile phone/tablet) close to the upper side of XPLR-IOT-1. For details about the location of the NFC antenna in XPLR-IOT-1, please refer to [XPLR-IOT-1 User Guide](https://www.u-blox.com/docs/UBX-21035674).

Once XPLR-IOT-1 is scanned, the [XPLR-IOT-1 quick start](https://developer.thingstream.io/guides/iot-communication-as-a-service/hardware/xplr-iot-1-quick-start-guide) website should be launched in the scanning device (mobile phone/tablet).
